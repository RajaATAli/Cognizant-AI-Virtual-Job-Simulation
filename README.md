# Cognizant AI Virtual Job Simulation
This repository contains the **five** tasks I did through the Cognizant Virtual Job Simulation offered by Forage.

It took me a total of **1 week** to complete this job simulation.

## Task 1: Data Analysis

<u>What I learned in this task:</u>
- How to use Python to analyze real world data sets (e.g.   transaction data from a grocery store)
- Genereate insights from the data and report my findings to the Data Science Team Leader to help them better understand the business and make informed decisions
- I used `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` libraries to analyze the data
