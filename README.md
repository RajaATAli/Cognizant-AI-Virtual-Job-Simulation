# Cognizant AI Virtual Job Simulation

This repository contains the **five** tasks I completed during the Cognizant Virtual Job Simulation offered by Forage.

It took me a total of **1 week** to complete this job simulation.

- [Task 4: Develop a Python module](#task-4-develop-a-python-module)
- [Task 5: Evaluating the production Machine Learning Model](#task-5-evaluating-the-production-machine-learning-model)

## Task 1: Data Analysis

**<u>What I learned in this task:</u>**
- How to use Python to analyze real-world datasets (e.g., transaction data from a grocery store)
- Generate insights from the data and report my findings to the Data Science Team Leader to help them better understand the business and make informed decisions
- I used `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` libraries to analyze the data
