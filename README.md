## Introduction

This repository presents my journey through the Cognizant Virtual Job Simulation offered by Forage. 

## How to Use

Each task is organized into its own folder, with the code and related resources available for review. 

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Analysis

**What I learned in this task:**
- How to use Python to analyze real-world datasets (e.g., transaction data from a grocery store)
- Generate insights from the data and report my findings to the Data Science Team Leader to help them better understand the business and make informed decisions
- I used `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` libraries to analyze the data

###### Below is an example of a distribution plot generated from the `quantity` column of the dataset:

###### The correlation plot below shows the correlation between the `unit price`, `quantity`, and `total` columns of the dataset:

- A correlation plot is a type of plot that shows the relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1 that represents the strength of the relationship between two variables. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no relationship between the two variables.

### Task 2: Data Science Process

**What I learned in this task:**
- How to use the data science process to solve a real-world problem

### Task 3: Modeling Predictive Machine Learning Processes

**<Coming Soon>**

### Task 4: Develop a Python Module

**<Coming Soon>**

### Task 5: Evaluating the Machine Learning Model
