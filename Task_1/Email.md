# Email to Data Science Team Leader regarding progress, key findings from analysis, and recommendations for next steps

Dear Data Science Team Leader,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to update you on the progress we have made on our task of analyzing the transaction dataset with Gala Groceries.

**Here are the key findings from our analysis:**

- Fruit & vegetables are the 2 most frequently bought product categories
- Non-members are the most frequent buyers within the store
- 11am is the busiest hour interms of numbers of transactions
- Our dataset consists of **7829** transactions, each with nine features/columns: 'transaction_id', 'timestamp', 'product_id', 'category', 'customer_type', 'unit_price', 'quantity', 'total', and 'payment_type'. **There are no missing values in the data.**
- The most commonly purchased categories are **'fruit', 'vegetables', and 'packaged foods',** while the least purchased are **'spices and herbs', 'pets', and 'personal care'.**
- 'Cash' is the most used payment type followed closely by 'credit card', 'e-wallet', and 'debit card'.
- ‘Unit price’ of $3.99 and $4.99 has the most count (374 count each)
- There's a strong positive correlation between the 'unit_price' and the 'total' amount paid in a transaction (0.792), and a moderate positive correlation between the 'quantity' and the 'total' amount paid (0.521).  There is a negligible correlation (0.0245) between ‘quantity’ and ‘unit_price.’

**Given our current findings, and based on the question the client posed `(How to better stock the items that they sell.)` here are my recommendations for our next steps:**
- We need more data as the current file only covers 1 week and 1 store
- We could further analyze the 'timestamp' feature to understand Gala Groceries transaction patterns over time. This could provide insights into the their busiest times of the day, week, or month, which can help in resource planning.
- We should also consider conducting a deeper analysis of customer behavior by looking at the distribution and relationship between different categories and payment types. (Are there certain categories that are more likely to be purchased with a specific payment type? Are there certain combinations of category and payment type that are particularly common or uncommon?)
- We could benefit from more data on customer demographics (like age, gender, and location) and product details (like supplier, brand, and profit margins), to gain a better understanding of who Gala Groceries customers are and which products are most profitable.

Please let me know if you need further clarification or if there's anything else that you'd like me to do.

Best regards,
Raja Allmdar Tariq Ali
